# Security Policy

The following security policy covers the AetherFlow CE (Community Edition) as 
seen here within this GitHub repository. For reporting any suspected vulnerabilities
within AetherFlow Pro, please create a private listing within our AetherFlow Labs ([here](https://lab.aetherflow.io/AetherFlow/Pro/-/issues)).

## Supported Versions

The AetherFlow Community Edition is under limited development and support. 
Meaning, it is a community aimed project. As such, any future developments are 
on hold as we focus on our AetherFlow Pro project. We do however take reports
of security issues seriously and will work to have these patched upstream
in a timely manner. As such, any security reports and subsequent patches are
posted upstream on a rolling commit basis covering latest versions as they are
released within our master branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is of the highest importance and all security vulnerabilities or suspected 
security vulnerabilities should be reported to AetherFlow.IO privately, to minimize attacks 
against current users of AetherFlow before they are fixed. Vulnerabilities will be 
investigated and patched on the next patch (or minor) release as soon as possible. 
This information could be kept entirely internal to the project.

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability for AetherFlow CE, 
please IMMEDIATELY contact sec@aetherflow.io to inform the AetherFlow.IO Team.

*IMPORTANT: Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities*

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities to sec@aetherflow.io. 
You will receive a response from us within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, 
we will release a patch as soon as possible depending on complexity but 
historically within a few days.
