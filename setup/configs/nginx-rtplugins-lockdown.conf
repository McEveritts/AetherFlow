# Nginx Security Lockdown for ruTorrent Plugins
# 
# AetherFlow explicitly configures plugins like filemanager and fileupload. 
# It is important to prevent direct execution of PHP files within the 
# ruTorrent plugins directory by bypassing the front controller.
#
# Usage:
# Include this snippet within your specific server {} block 
# in your Nginx configuration, typically before your main PHP handler.

location ~ ^/rutorrent/plugins/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
    return 403;
}
